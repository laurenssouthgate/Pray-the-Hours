            <h2>Psalm 50</h2>
            <p>
                Have mercy on me, O God, according to Thy great mercy; and according to the multitude of Thy compassions blot out my transgression.
                Wash me thoroughly from mine iniquity, and cleanse me from my sin.
                For I know mine iniquity, and my sin is ever before me.
                Against Thee only have I sinned and done this evil before Thee, that Thou mightest be justified in Thy words, and prevail when Thou art judged.
                For behold, I was conceived in iniquities, and in sins did my mother bear me.
                For behold, Thou hast loved truth; the hidden and secret things of Thy wisdom hast Thou made manifest unto me.
                Thou shalt sprinkle me with hyssop, and I shall be made clean; Thou shalt wash me, and I shall be made whiter than snow.
                Thou shalt make me to hear joy and gladness; the bones that be humbled, they shall rejoice.
                Turn Thy face away from my sins, and blot out all mine iniquities.
                Create in me a clean heart, O God, and renew a right spirit within me.
                Cast me not away from Thy presence, and take not Thy Holy Spirit from me.
                Restore unto me the joy of Thy salvation, and with Thy governing Spirit establish me.
                I shall teach transgressors Thy ways, and the ungodly shall turn back unto Thee.
                Deliver me from blood-guiltiness, O God, Thou God of my salvation; my tongue shall rejoice in Thy righteousness.
                O Lord, Thou shalt open my lips, and my mouth shall declare Thy praise.
                For if Thou hadst desired sacrifice, I had given it; with whole-burnt offerings Thou shalt not be pleased.
                A sacrifice unto God is a broken spirit; a heart that is broken and humbled God will not despise.
                Do good, O Lord, in Thy good pleasure unto Sion, and let the walls of Jerusalem be builded.
                Then shalt Thou be pleased with a sacrifice of righteousness, with oblation and whole-burnt offerings.
                Then shall they offer bullocks upon Thine altar. 
            </p>
            <h2>Psalm 69
            </h2>
            <p>
                O God, be attentive unto helping me; O Lord, make haste to help me.
                Let them be shamed and confounded that seek after my soul.
                Let them be turned back and brought to shame that desire evils against me.
                Let them be turned back straightway in shame that say unto me: Well done! Well done!
                Let them be glad and rejoice in Thee all that seek after Thee, O God, and let them that love Thy salvation say continually: The Lord be magnified.
                But as for me, I am poor and needy; O God, come unto mine aid.
                My helper and my deliverer art Thou, O Lord; make no long tarrying. 
            </p>
            <h2>Psalm 142</h2>
            <p>
                O Lord, hear my prayer, give ear unto my supplication in Thy truth; hearken unto me in Thy righteousness.
                And enter not into judgement with Thy servant, for in Thy sight shall no man living be justified.
                For the enemy hath persecuted my soul; he hath humbled my life down to the earth.
                He hath sat me in darkness as those that have been long dead, and my spirit within me is become despondent; within me my heart is troubled.
                I remembered days of old, I meditated on all Thy works, I pondered on the creations of Thy hands.
                I stretched forth my hands unto Thee; my soul thirsteth after Thee like a waterless land.
                Quickly hear me, O Lord; my spirit hath fainted away.
                Turn not Thy face away from me, lest I be like unto them that go down into the pit.
                Cause me to hear Thy mercy in the morning; for in Thee have I put my hope.
                Cause me to know, O Lord, the way wherein I should walk; for unto Thee have I lifted up my soul.
                Rescue me from mine enemies, O Lord; unto Thee have I fled for refuge. Teach me to do Thy will, for Thou art my God.
                Thy good Spirit shall lead me in the land of uprightness; for Thy name's sake, O Lord, shalt Thou quicken me.
                In Thy righteousness shalt Thou bring my soul out of affliction, and in Thy mercy shalt Thou utterly destroy mine enemies.
                And Thou shalt cut off all them that afflict my soul, for I am Thy servant.

            <h4>Doxology</h4>
            <p>
                Glory to God in the highest, and on earth, peace and good will among men. We praise Thee, we bless Thee, we worship Thee, 
                we glorify Thee, we give thanks to Thee for Thy great glory. O Lord, heavenly King, God the Father Almighty; O Lord, the 
                only-begotten Son, Jesus Christ; and O Holy Spirit. O Lord God, Lamb of God, Son of the Father, that takest away the sin of 
                the world; have mercy on us; Thou that takest away the sins of the world, receive our prayer; Thou that sittest at the right 
                hand of the Father, have mercy on us. For Thou only art holy; Thou only art the Lord, O Jesus Christ, to the glory of God the Father. 
                Amen. Every night will I bless Thee, and I will praise Thy Name forever, yea, forever and forever. Lord, thou hast been our refuge in 
                generation and generation. I said: O Lord, have mercy on me, heal my soul, for I have sinned against Thee. O Lord, unto Thee have 
                I fled for refuge, teach me to do Thy will, for Thou art my God. For in Thee is the fountain of life, in Thy light shall we 
                see light. O continue Thy mercy unto them that know Thee. Vouchsafe, O Lord, to keep us this night without sin. Blessed art Thou, 
                O Lord, the God of our Fathers, and praised and glorified is Thy name unto the ages of ages. Amen. Let Thy mercy, O Lord, 
                be upon us, according as we have hoped in Thee. Blessed art Thou, O Lord, teach me Thy statutes.. Blessed art Thou, O Master, 
                give me understanding of Thy statutes. Blessed art Thou, O Holy One, enlighten me by Thy statutes. O Lord, Thy mercy endureth forever;
                disdain not the works of Thy hands. To Thee is due praise, to Thee is due a song, to Thee glory is due, to the Father, and to the Son,
                and to the Holy Spirit, now and ever, and unto the ages of ages. Amen.

            <h4>The Symbol of Faith</h4>
            <p>
                I believe in one God, the Father Almighty, Maker of heaven and the earth and of all things visible and invisible. And in one Lord Jesus Christ, 
                the Son of God, the Only-begotten, begotten of the Father before all ages; Light of Light, true God of true God; begotten, not made; of one 
                essence with the Father, by Whom all things were made; Who for us men and for our salvation came down from the heavens, and was incarnate of 
                the Holy Spirit and the Virgin Mary, and became man; And was crucified for us under Pontius Pilate, and suffered and was buried; And arose 
                again on the third day according to the Scriptures; And ascended into the heavens, and sitteth at the right hand of the Father; And shall 
                come again, with glory, to judge both the living and the dead; Whose kingdom shall have no end. And in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, 
                the Giver of life; Who proceedeth from the Father; Who with the Father and the Son together is worshipped and glorified; Who spake by 
                the prophets. In One, Holy, Catholic, and Apostolic Church. I confess one baptism for the remission . of sins. I look for the resurrection of 
                the dead, And the life of the age to come. Amen.

                our life in peace.
            </p>
            <p>
                Adorned in the blood of Thy martyrs throughout all the world, as in purple and fine linen, Thy Church, through them, doth cry unto Thee, O Christ
                God: Send down Thy compassions upon Thy people; grant peace to Thy community, and to our souls great mercy.

            <p class="holy-fathers"></p>
            <h4>Prayer to the Most Holy Theotokos</h4>
            <p>
                O undefiled, untainted, uncorrupted, most pure, chaste Virgin, Thou Bride of God and Sovereign Lady, who didst unite the Word of God to mankind though 
                thy most glorious birth giving, and hast linked the apostate nature of our race with the heavenly; who art the only hope of the hopeless, and the helper 
                of the struggling, the ever-ready protection of them that hasten unto thee, and the refuge of all Christians: Do not shrink with loathing from me a sinner, 
                defiled, who with polluted thoughts, words, and deeds have made myself utterly unprofitable, and through slothfulness of mind have become a slave to the 
                pleasures of life. But as the Mother of God Who loveth mankind, show thy love for mankind and mercifully have compassion upon me a sinner and prodigal, 
                and accept my supplication, which is offered to thee out of my defiled mouth; and making use of thy motherly boldness, entreat thy Son and our Master and 
                Lord that He may be pleased to open for me the bowels of His lovingkindness and graciousness to mankind, and, disregarding my numberless offenses, will 
                turn me back to repentance, and show me to be tried worker of His precepts. And be thou ever present unto me as merciful, compassionate and well disposed; 
                in the present life be thou a fervent intercessor and helper, repelling the assaults of adversaries and guiding me to salvation, and at the time of my departure 
                taking care of my miserable soul, and driving far away from it the dark countenances of the evil demons; lastly, at the dreadful day of judgment delivering me 
                from torment eternal and showing me to be an heir of the ineffable glory of thy Son and our God; all of which may I attain, O my Sovereign Lady, most holy 
                Theotokos, in virtue of thine intercession and protection, through the grace and love to mankind of thine only begotten Son, our Lord and God and Savior, 
                Jesus Christ, to Whom is due all glory, honor and worship, together with His unoriginate Father, and His Most Holy and good and life creating Spirit, 
                now and ever, and unto ages of ages. Amen. 
            </p>
            <h4>Prayer to our Lord Jesus Christ</h4>
            <p>
                And grant unto us, O Master, in the coming sleep, rest for body and soul, and preserve us from the gloomy slumber of sin, and from every dark and nocturnal 
                sensuality. Subdue the impulses of passions, extinguish the fiery darts of the evil one that are cunningly hurled against us, assuage the rebellions of our 
                flesh, and every earthly and fleshly subtlety of ours lull to sleep. And grant unto us, O God, a watchful mind, chaste thought, a sober heart, a sleep gentle 
                and free from every satanic illusion. Raise us up at the time of prayer firmly grounded in Thy judgments. All the night long grant us a doxology, that we may 
                hymn and bless and glorify Thy most honorable and majestic name: of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, now and ever, and unto the ages of 
                ages. Amen. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Most glorious Ever-Virgin, Mother of Christ God, present our prayer to thy Son and our God, that through thee our souls may be saved
            </p>
            <p>
                My hope is the Father, my refuge is the Son, my protection is the Holy Spirit: O Holy Trinity, glory to Thee.
            </p>
            <p>
                All my hope I place in thee, O Mother of God: keep me under thy protection.
            </p>
            <p>
                O Angel of Christ, my holy guardian and protector of my soul and body, forgive me all wherein I have sinned this day, and deliver me from all opposing evil of 
                mine enemy, lest I anger my God by any sin. Pray for me, a sinful and unworthy servant, that thou mayest show me forth worthy of the kindness and mercy of the 
                All-holy Trinity, and of the Mother of my Lord Jesus Christ, and of all the saints. Amen.
            </p>
            <p>
                O Theotokos and virgin, rejoice, Mary, full of grace; the Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb for thou hast
                born the Saviour of our souls. (x3)
