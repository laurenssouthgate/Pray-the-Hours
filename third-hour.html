            <h2>Psalm 16</h2>
            <p>
                Hearken, O Lord, unto my righteousness, attend unto my supplication. Give ear unto my prayer, which cometh not from deceitful lips.
                From before Thy face let my judgement come forth, let mine eyes behold uprightness.
                Thou hast proved my heart, Thou hast visited it in the night, Thou hast tried me by fire, and unrighteousness was not found in me.
                That my mouth might not speak of the works of men, for the sake of the words of Thy lips have I kept the ways that are hard.
                Set my footsteps in Thy paths, that my steps may not be shaken.
                I have cried for Thou hast hearkened unto me, O God. Incline Thine ear unto me, and hearken unto my words.
                Let Thy mercies be made wonderful, O Thou that savest them that hope in Thee.
                From them that have resisted Thy right hand, keep me, O Lord, as the apple of Thine eye.
                In the shelter of Thy wings wilt Thou shelter me, from the face of the ungodly which have oppressed me.
                Mine enemies have surrounded my soul, they have enclosed themselves with their own fat, their mouth hath spoken pride.
                They that cast me out have now encircled me, they have set their eyes to look askance on the earth.
                They have taken me as might a lion ready for his prey, and as might a lion's whelp that dwelleth in hiding.
                Arise, O Lord, overtake them and trip their heels; deliver my soul from ungodly men, Thy sword from the enemies of Thy hand.
                O Lord, from Thy few do Thou separate them from the earth in their life; yea, with Thy hidden treasures hath their belly been filled.
                They have satisfied themselves with swine and have left the remnants to their babes.
                But as for me, in righteousness shall I appear before Thy face; I shall be filled when Thy glory is made manifest to me.

            <h2>Psalm 24
            </h2>
            <p>
                Unto Thee, O Lord, have I lifted up my soul.
                O my God, in Thee have I trusted; let me never be put to shame, nor let mine enemies laugh me to scorn.
                Yea, let none that wait on Thee be put to shame; let them be ashamed which are lawless without a cause.
                Make Thy ways, O Lord, known unto me and teach me Thy paths.
                Lead me in Thy truth and teach me, for Thou art God my Saviour; for on Thee have I waited all the day long.
                Remember Thy compassions; O Lord, and Thy mercies, for they are from everlasting.
                The sins of my youth and mine ignorances remember not; according to Thy mercy remember Thou me, for the sake of Thy goodness, O Lord.
                Good and upright is the Lord; therefore will He set a law for them that sin in the way.
                He will guide the meek in judgement, He will teach the meek His ways.
                All the ways of the Lord are mercy and truth, unto them that seek after His covenant and His testimonies.
                For the sake of Thy name, O Lord, be gracious unto my sin; for it is great.
                Who is the man that feareth the Lord? He will set him a law in the way which He hath chosen.
                His soul shall dwell among good things, and his seed shall inherit the earth.
                The Lord is the strength of them that fear Him, and His covenant shall be manifested unto them.
                Mine eyes are ever toward the Lord, for He it is that will draw my feet out of the snare.
                Look upon me, and have mercy on me; for I am one only-begotten and poor.
                The afflictions of my heart are multiplied; bring me out from my necessities.
                Behold my lowliness and my toil, and forgive all my sins.
                Look upon my enemies, for they are multiplied, and with an unjust hatred they have hated me.
                Keep my soul and rescue me; let me not be put to shame, for I have hoped in Thee.
                The innocent and the upright have cleaved unto me, for I waited on Thee, O Lord.
                Redeem Israel, O God, out of all his afflictions. 
            </p>
            <h2>Psalm 50</h2>
            <p>
                Have mercy on me, O God, according to Thy great mercy; and according to the multitude of Thy compassions blot out my transgression.
                Wash me thoroughly from mine iniquity, and cleanse me from my sin.
                For I know mine iniquity, and my sin is ever before me.
                Against Thee only have I sinned and done this evil before Thee, that Thou mightest be justified in Thy words, and prevail when Thou art judged.
                For behold, I was conceived in iniquities, and in sins did my mother bear me.
                For behold, Thou hast loved truth; the hidden and secret things of Thy wisdom hast Thou made manifest unto me.
                Thou shalt sprinkle me with hyssop, and I shall be made clean; Thou shalt wash me, and I shall be made whiter than snow.
                Thou shalt make me to hear joy and gladness; the bones that be humbled, they shall rejoice.
                Turn Thy face away from my sins, and blot out all mine iniquities.
                Create in me a clean heart, O God, and renew a right spirit within me.
                Cast me not away from Thy presence, and take not Thy Holy Spirit from me.
                Restore unto me the joy of Thy salvation, and with Thy governing Spirit establish me.
                I shall teach transgressors Thy ways, and the ungodly shall turn back unto Thee.
                Deliver me from blood-guiltiness, O God, Thou God of my salvation; my tongue shall rejoice in Thy righteousness.
                O Lord, Thou shalt open my lips, and my mouth shall declare Thy praise.
                For if Thou hadst desired sacrifice, I had given it; with whole-burnt offerings Thou shalt not be pleased.
                A sacrifice unto God is a broken spirit; a heart that is broken and humbled God will not despise.
                Do good, O Lord, in Thy good pleasure unto Sion, and let the walls of Jerusalem be builded.
                Then shalt Thou be pleased with a sacrifice of righteousness, with oblation and whole-burnt offerings.
                Then shall they offer bullocks upon Thine altar.
