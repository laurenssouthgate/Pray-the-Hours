            <h2>Psalm 83</h2>
            <p>
                How beloved are Thy dwellings, O Lord of hosts; my soul longeth and fainteth for the courts of the Lord.
                My heart and my flesh have rejoiced in the living God.
                For the sparrow hath found herself a house, and the turtledove a nest for herself where she may lay her young,
                Even Thine altars, O Lord of hosts, my King and my God.
                Blessed are they that dwell in Thy house; unto ages of ages shall they praise Thee.
                Blessed is the man whose help is from Thee; he hath made ascents in his heart, in the vale of weeping, in the place which he hath appointed.
                Yea, for the lawgiver will give blessings; they shall go from strength to strength, the God of gods shall be seen in Sion.
                O Lord of hosts, hearken unto my prayer; give ear, O God of Jacob.
                O God, our defender, behold, and look upon the face of Thine anointed one.
                For better is one day in Thy courts than thousands elsewhere.
                I have chosen rather to be an outcast in the house of my God than to dwell in the tents of sinners.
                For the Lord loveth mercy and truth, God will give grace and glory; the Lord will not withhold good things from them that walk in innocence.
                O Lord God of hosts, blessed is the man that hopeth in Thee.

            <h2>Psalm 84
            </h2>
            <p>
                Thou hast been gracious, O Lord, unto Thy land; Thou hast turned back the captivity of Jacob.
                Thou hast forgiven the iniquities of Thy people, Thou hast covered all their sins.
                Thou hast made all Thy wrath to cease, Thou hast turned back from the wrath of Thine anger.
                Turn us back, O God of our salvation, and turn away Thine anger from us.
                Wilt Thou be wroth with us unto the ages? Or wilt Thou draw out Thy wrath from generation to generation?
                O God, Thou wilt turn and quicken us, and Thy people shall be glad in Thee.
                Show us, O Lord, Thy mercy, and Thy salvation do Thou give unto us.
                I will hear what the Lord God will speak in me; for He will speak peace to His people and to His saints and to them that turn their heart unto Him.
                Surely nigh unto them that fear Him is His salvation, that glory may dwell in our land.
                Mercy and truth are met together, righteousness and peace have kissed each other.
                Truth is sprung up out of the earth, and righteousness hath looked down from heaven.
                Yea, for the Lord will give goodness, and our land shall yield her fruit.
                Righteousness shall go before Him and shall set His footsteps in the way.

            <h2>Psalm 85</h2>
            <p>
                Bow down Thine ear, O Lord, and hearken unto me, for poor and needy am I.
                Preserve my soul, for I am holy; save Thy servant, O my God, that hopeth in Thee.
                Have mercy on me, O Lord, for unto Thee will I cry all the day long; make glad the soul of Thy servant, for unto Thee have I lifted up my soul.
                For Thou, O Lord, art good and gentle, and plenteous in mercy unto all them that call upon Thee.
                Give ear, O Lord, unto my prayer, and attend unto the voice of my supplication.
                In the day of mine affliction have I cried unto Thee, for Thou hast heard me.
                There is none like unto Thee among the gods, O Lord, nor are there any works like unto Thy works.
                All the nations whom Thou hast made shall come and shall worship before Thee, O Lord, and shall glorify Thy name.
                For Thou art great and workest wonders; Thou alone art God.
                Guide me, O Lord, in Thy way, and I will walk in Thy truth; let my heart rejoice that I may fear Thy name.
                I will confess Thee, O Lord my God, with all my heart, and I will glorify Thy name for ever.
                For great is Thy mercy upon me, and Thou hast delivered my soul from the nethermost hades.
                O God, transgressors have risen up against me, and the assembly of the mighty hath sought after my soul, and they have not set Thee before them.
                But Thou, O Lord my God, art compassionate and merciful, long-suffering and plenteous in mercy, and true.
                Look upon me and have mercy upon me; give Thy strength unto Thy servant, and save the son of Thy handmaiden.
                Work in me a sign unto good, and let them that hate me behold and be put to shame; for Thou, O Lord, hast holpen me and comforted me.

            <h4>Prayer of St. Basil the Great</h4>
            <p>O Master, Lord Jesus Christ, our God, Who art long-suffering in the face of our transgressions, and Who hast brought us even unto this present hour,
                wherein Thou didst hang upon the life-giving Tree, and didst make a way into paradise for the wise theif, and by death didst destroy death: Be gracious
                unto us sinners and Thine unworthy servants; for we have sinned and committed iniquity, and are not worthy to lift up our eyes and behold the height of
                heaven, for we have abandoned the way of Thy righteousness, and have walked in the desires of our hearts. But we beseech Thy boundless goodness: Spare us,
                O Lord, according to the multitude of Thy mercy and save us for Thy holy name's sake; for our days were consumed in vanity. Rescue us from the hand of the 
                adversary, and forgive us our sins, and mortify our carnal mind; that, putting aside the old man, we may be clad with the new, and live for Thee, our Master
                and Benefactor; and that thus by following Thy commandments, we may attain to rest everlasting, wherein is the dwelling-place of all them that rejoice.
                For Thou art indeed the true joy and gladness of them that love Thee, O Christ our God, and unto Thee we send up glory, with Thine unoriginate Father, and
                Thy Most-holy and good and life-creating Spirit, now and ever, and unto the ages of ages. Amen.
