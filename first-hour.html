            <h2>Psalm 5</h2>
            <p>
                Unto my words give ear, O Lord; hear my cry. Attend unto the voice of my supplication, O my King and my God; for unto Thee will I pray,
                O Lord. In the morning Thou shalt hear my voice. In the morning shall I stand before Thee, and Thou shalt look upon me; for not a God
                that willest iniquity art Thou. He that worketh evil shall not dwell near Thee, nor shall transgressors abide before Thine eyes. Thou
                hast hated all them that work iniquity; Thou shalt destroy all them that speak a lie. A man that is bloody and deceitful shall the Lord
                abhor. But as for me, in the multitude of Thy mercy shall I go into Thy house; I shall worship toward Thy holy temple in fear of Thee. O
                Lord, guide me in the way of Thy righteousness; because of mine enemies, make straight my way before Thee, for in their mouth there is no truth;
                their heart is vain. Their throat is an open sepulchre, with their tongues have they spoken decietfully; judge them, O God. Let them fall
                down on account of their own devisings; according to the multitude of their ungodliness, cast them out, for they have embittered Thee, O Lord.
                And let all them be glad that hope in Thee; they shall ever rejoice, and Thou shalt dwell among them. All all shall glory in Thee that love
                Thy name, for Thou shalt bless the righteous. O Lord, as with a shield of Thy good pleasure hast Thou crowned us.
            </p>
            <h2>Psalm 89</h2>
            <p>
                Lord, Thou hast been our refuge in generation and generation. Before the mountains came to be and the earth was formed and the world, even from
                everlasting to everlasting Thou art. Turn not man away unto lowliness; yea, Thou has said: Turn back, ye sons of men. For a thousand years in
                Thine eyes, O Lord, are but as yesterday that is past, and as a watch in the night. Things of no account shall their years be; in the morning
                like grass shall man pass away. In the morning shall he bloom and pass away, in the evening shall he fall and grow withered and dry. For we have
                fainted away in Thy wrath, and in Thine anger have we been troubled. Thou hast set our iniquities before Thee; our lifespan is in the light of Thy
                countenance. For all our days are faded away, and in Thy wrath are we fainted away; our years have, like a spider, spun out their tale. As for the 
                days of our years, in their span they be threescore years and ten. And if we be in strength, mayhap fourscore years; and what is more than these is
                toil and travail. For mildness is come upon us, and we shall be chastened. Who knoweth the might of Thy wrath? And out of fear of Thee, who can recount 
                Thine anger? So make Thy right hand known to me, and to them that in their heart are instructed in wisdom. Return, O Lord; how long? And be Thou entreated
                concerning Thy servants. We were filled in the morning with Thy mercy, O Lord, and we rejoiced and were glad. In all our days, let us be glad for the days
                wherein Thou didst humble us, for the years wherein we saw evils. And look upon Thy servants, and upon Thy works, and do Thou guide their sons. And let
                the brightness of the Lord our God be upon us, and the works of our hands do Thou guide aright upon us, yea, the work of our hands do Thou guide aright.
            </p>
            <h2>Psalm 100</h2>
            <p>
                Of mercy and judgement will I sing unto Thee, O Lord; I will chant and have understanding in a blameless path. When wilt Thou come unto me? I have walked
                in the innocence of my heart in the midst of my house. I have no unlawful thing before mine eyes; the workers of transgressions I have hated. A crooked
                heart hath not cleaved unto me; as for the wicked man who turned from me, I knew him not. Him that privily talked against his neighbour did I drive away
                from me. With him whose eye was proud and his heart insatiate, I did not eat. Mine eyes were upon the faithful of the land, that they might sit with me; the man
                that walked in a blameless path, he ministered unto me. The proud doer dwelt not in the midst of my house; the speaker of unjust things prospered not
                before mine eyes. In the morning I slew all the sinners of the land, utterly to destroy out of the city of the Lord all them that work iniquity.

            <p>O Christ the True Light, Who enlightenest and sanctifiest every man that cometh into the world: Let the light of Thy countenance be signed upon us, that in it
                we may see the Unapproachable Light, and guide our steps in the doing of Thy commandments, through the intercessions of Thy most pure Mother, and of all Thy
                Saints. Amen

                To thee, the Champion Leader, we thy servants dedicate a feast of victory and of thanksgiving as ones rescued out of sufferings, O Theotokos; but as thou art 
                one with might which is invincible, from all dangers that can be do thou deliver us, that we may cry to thee: Rejoice, thou Bride Unwedded!
